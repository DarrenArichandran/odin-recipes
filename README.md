I am making my first landing page

The challeneges so far 
    - not sure how but ssh key was already in use and forgotten where i last used so made a new one and linked the repo to it
    - needed to then work out how to clone the repo to my local machine
    - tested to ensure all is correct and verified it is indeed connected
